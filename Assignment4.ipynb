    "The Client code runs a client process that listens for button presses and sends messages to the server depending on which buttons were pressed.

Lines 4 and 5 define the `SOUND_ALARM_MSG`, `DISCONNECT_MSG`, and `KILL_SERVER_MSG` constants, and must exactly match the messages that the server expects to receive. Finally the Debounce time is set to be slightly longer than the buzzer play time, to stop the client from sending `SOUND_ALARM_MSG`'s faster than the server can play them. \n",

If `Button 1` on the board is pressed then the `SOUND_ALARM_MSG` is sent to the server. If `Button 1` is pressed, the `DISCONNECT_MSG` is sent to the server, the socket is closed, the `running_clinet` variable is set to false to break the while loop, and the function returns `True`. If `Button 3` is pressed then the `KILL_SERVER_MSG` is sent to the server, the socket is closed, and the function returns `False`.\n",

If it is pressed then the `run_client()` function is called. If `run_client()` returns `True` then the loop continues and the client can be reconnected by pressing `Button 0` again. If `run_clinet()` returns `False` then the kill button was pressed so the loop ends and client process joins. "
